Summary of my findings: After analyzing, it is found that the alignment scores between human ACE2 protein (Q9BYF1) and mouse ACE2 protein (Q8R0I0), between human ACE2 protein (Q9BYF1) and cat ACE2 protein (Q56H28), and between mouse ACE2 protein (Q8R0I0) and cat ACE2 protein (Q56H28) are 3579, 3717 and 3592 respectively. The percentages of identical amino acids for these three comparisons are 82.11180124223603%, 85.21739130434783% and 81.73913043478261% respectively. 
Interpretation: Human's sequence and cat's sequence are the most closely related. I think from these data, we can make the interpretation that during the evolution of the ACE2 protein, ACE2 protein of all three species developed into three different branches at different time and the branching of ACE2 protein of human and cat is later than the branching of mouse's ACE2 protein. Because of that, among these three species, kinship between humans and cats is the most close.
